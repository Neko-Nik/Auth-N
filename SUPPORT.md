# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using `Auth-N`? Here's how.

## How to get help

Use GitHub issues for **bug reports** and **feature requests**. For general questions, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/Auth-N/discussions). This is the best way to get help with the Auth-N project.

## How to ask for help

When asking for help, please follow these guidelines:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** of Auth N to see if you can figure it out on your own. The documentation is available at [Auth-N Documentation](https://auth-n.nekonik.com). See if there are any guides or tutorials that can help you.

2. :bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/Auth-N/discussions)**. This is the best place to ask general questions about Auth-N. You can also search for existing discussions to see if your question has already been answered.

3. :memo: As a **last resort**, you may open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/Auth-N/issues) to ask for help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug. Review our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/Auth-N/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What NOT to do 

Please **do not** do any the following:

1. :x: Do not reach out to the contributor on Twitter (or other social media) by tweeting or sending a direct message.

2. :x: Do not email the author or contributor unless it is a [security issue](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/Auth-N/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

3. :x: Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community. ✌️
