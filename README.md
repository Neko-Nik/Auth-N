- Role-based access control with support for various user roles and permissions.
- Password policy enforcement and management, including password reset and change functionalities.
- Multi-factor authentication options such as password less login and two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Enhanced security features including JWT token authentication, IP-based restriction, and CSRF protection.
- Audit logging to track user actions and system activities.
- Seamless integration with other services via API key authentication and machine-to-machine communication.
